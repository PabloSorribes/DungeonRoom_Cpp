This game was made as an assignment for learning about working with C++ in Unreal Engine 4. The assignment was part of a course during the "Game Programming"-programme at YRGO, the Vocational University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

I learned a great deal and would never recommend  anyone to do a game entirely in C++ for Unreal Engine, cause goddamn is that part *buggy*. For game functionality, keep to Blueprints. It's much safer, faster to work with, and generally better. The C++ classes can and should only be used when doing complicated mathematical checks, since doing that in Blueprints quickly makes it become spaghetti-code for real.
